As a [freelancer web consultant](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~019c06dd3d4065a0ac/), there is important to keep our client code base in private repositories. With the client that has a high budget, that is easy because can buy private repositories and integrate with premium and enterprise tools that extend more quality to the project. But instead, if client come with the low budget, none technical or just testing their startup idea then we need a free private repositories solution for them. So all of this page contents come from my experiences with the free private repository..

Recently, Github allows the user to create the private repositories for free [(Check Here)](https://github.com/pricing). Which [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) have been providing this for a long time. I am happy to see that as I like the good performance of Github.

So immediately something come to my mind. Should I move my private repositories to GitHub? Absolutely, Yes and No (ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£). My answer seems a little bit confusing but it came with the reason.

### Why Yes?

I will some of my free archived private repositories to GitHub.

* ***Performance***: GitHub comes with good speed that easy to browse, access, push, pull and collaborate.
* ***Interface***: GitHub comes with a simple interface which easies to use
* ***All In One***: As I am an open source developer that allow browsing all my dependencies, documents and projects in one place.
* ***Profile Activities***: This is can be my portfolios when a new client comes to review my profile. So they can see my current activities status to active.
* ***Trust***: Think everyone the same as me who trust in stability and maintainability of the GitHub. Like the shocking moment last time that GitLab dropped their database.

### Why No?

I still stick some of my free active private repositories to GitLab.

* ***Containerize***: GitLab allows to store docker images for free as my projects used containerize technology.
* ***CI/CD***: GitLab provides more than the free private repo. But they provide free build hours to my projects too.
* ***Team Limitation***: GitLab provides unlimited to collaborators to private repositories which I can scale my team or add my client to view the source code.
* ***All tools in one place***: On GitLab I can have CI/CD, pipeline, DevOps, Automation and Docker Register all in one place. Those required tools in development I can have it in one place without external services.
* ***Other Tools***: GitLab have a lot of tools more than just Git version control
* ***Future Self Hosted***: In future use, we can have our self-hosted GitLab that provide me Unlimited build, pipeline and automation time.

### Conclusion

This is just my personal idea from my experiences and my situation. But I may help you with your decision making. So please make your own comparations for your situation
